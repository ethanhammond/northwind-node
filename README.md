Want to run the project locally? Type `mongod` in a terminal window. This starts mongoDB. In a new window, type `npm start`. This starts the node project. To test if you have the necessary dependencies installed, after starting your database and npm, go to `localhost:3000` by default. A MEAN.js window should appear.
