To run the project locally, type `mongod` in a terminal window. This starts mongoDB. In a new window, type `npm start`. This starts the node project. To test if you have the necessary dependencies installed, after starting your database and npm, go to `localhost:3000` by default. A MEAN.js window should appear.

To kill the mongoDB server, type `killall mongod` in a terminal window. This can also fix errors caused by having more than one instance of mongoDB running at a time.

Note: Curl json POST to localhost currently doesn't return json data at the moment.
